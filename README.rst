pysquirrel
==========

pysquirrel is a Python package designed to fetch NUTS administrative
divisions.

The current NUTS version is valid from 1 January 2024.

From the `Eurostat
website <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview>`__:

“The `NUTS
classification <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics_(NUTS)>`__
(Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a hierarchical
system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU for the purpose
of: 
- the collection, development and harmonisation of European regional statistics 
- socio-economic analyses of the regions 
    - NUTS 1: major socio-economic regions 
    - NUTS 2: basic regions for the application of regional policies 
    - NUTS 3: small regions for specific diagnoses
- framing of EU regional policies 
- regions eligible for support from cohesion policy have been defined at NUTS 2 level
- the cohesion report has so far mainly been prepared at NUTS 2 level”

Usage
-----

pysquirrel allows searching the list of all territorial units by specifying the
parameters and the values to search as shown below:
